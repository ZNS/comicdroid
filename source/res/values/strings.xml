	<h2>Adding comics</h2>
	<strong>How does scan isbn work?</strong><br/>
	Most comics have the isbn-number written on them as a barcode. You can scan this barcode so you don\'t have to enter it manually. To be able to do this your phone must have a camera and you have to have \"Barcode scanner\" installed.<br/>
	<br/>
	<strong>Can I add a comic manually?</strong><br/>
	Yes by pressing the \"Create\" button. When editing you can also add an image by pressing the camera icon. Don\'t forget to save by pressing the \"check\"-icon on top.<br/>
	<br/>
	<strong>How does pick author/illustrator work?</strong><br/>
	Most comics have information about who\'s made them. However they aren\'t differentiated on authors and illustrators, so you\'ll have to do this yourself. Simply choose which name has which role. You can pick \"none\" to ignore this name.

	<h2>Comic</h2>
	<strong>What does \"Volume\" mean?</strong><br/>
	This is the number of the comic. We don\'t use \"Issue\" since ComicDroid is mostly meant for storing collected volumes.<br/>
	<br/>
	<strong>What does \"Collects the following\" mean?</strong><br/>
	This is meant to store which issues are collected in the comic volume. For example #1-6,#8-9.<br/>
	<br/>
	<strong>What does \"On loan to\" mean?</strong><br/>
	Here you can see or enter to whom this comic is lent out.

    <![CDATA[
	<h2>Collection</h2>
	<strong>How do I use a collection?</strong><br/>
	You create a collection either when you add comics or edit a comic. Collections are made to group comics together. Let\'s say for example that you have added eighteen volumes of \"The walking dead\" you\'d want to group them together into a collection called \"The walking dead\".<br/>
	<br/>
	<strong>How do is the image for the collection chosen?</strong><br/>
	The default image for a collection is the same image as the comic with volume 1 in the collection. You can change this by long pressing a comic in a collection and choosing \"Use image for collection\".<br/>
	<br/>
	<strong>What does Watch, Finished and Complete mean?</strong><br/>
	Watch: If you check this you can then see all your watched collections under \"Watched\" in the menu. This could for example be used for keeping track of which collections you are currently interested in buying.<br/>
	Finished: This is meant to indicate if there are still comics being released in this collection or not.<br/>
	Complete: This is meant to indicate if you have all the comics available in this collection.<br/>
	<br/>
	<strong>What does \"Edit all\" mean?</strong><br/>
	This means you can edit the information for all comics in a collection at once. Note that fields left empty will not be saved.

    <![CDATA[
	<h2>Editing</h2>
	<strong>Can I edit multiple comics at once?</strong><br/>
	Yes, by choosing \"Edit all\" under the top menu when viewing a collection. Read more under \"Collections\".<br/>
	<br/>
	<strong>Can I rename a author/illustrator/publisher?</strong><br/>
	Yes, you either do this in the archive by long pressing a name or by clicking the edit button when viewing comics for a name.
    ]]>
    </string>
    <string name="help_lending">
	<![CDATA[
	<h2>Lending</h2>
	<strong>How does \"Lend out\" work?</strong><br/>
	First enter the name of the borrower and then scan the isbn of the comic being lent out.<br/>
	<br/>
	<strong>What does the \"On loan to\" field in the comic view mean?</strong><br/>
	Here you can see or edit to whom this comic is lent out.<br/>

	<strong>How do I mark a comic as returned?</strong><br/>
	Under \"Lent out\" in the menu, click comics to return and then click the trash-can.

    <string name="help_settings">
    <![CDATA[
	<h2>Settings</h2>
	<strong>What does \"Publish to drive\" mean?</strong><br>
	If you enable this ComicDroid will create a new folder on your google drive account called \"ComicDroid\" here it will publish a HTML-page containing your archive. This means anyone can surf and watch your archive from anywhere using the link you\'ll see when you enable this setting.<br/>
	<br/>
	<strong>What does \"Backup to drive\" mean?</strong><br/>
	Enabling this allows ComicDroid to backup your archive to google drive. It will do this using a special appdata folder which isn\'t visible to you but you can manage it under settings on http://drive.google.com Backing up to google drive also gives you the possibility to restore your archive on another device.<br/>
	<br/>
	<strong>How does \"Wifi only\" work?</strong><br/>
	With this enabled ComicDroid will only backup your archive when you are connected via wifi. Note that enabling this might result in stale backups if you are not frequently connected via wifi.
